This was made for a larger project N.N.N. (See: https://github.com/Mar13554/N.N.N.-Neural-Network-Nexus)
You will need to run the file yourself (working on an .exe)
Modules needed: PyQt5 

Currently the only option for the convertion is one-to-one (words)
The code (as the name suggests) takes a paragraph and put out an I/O json file format of:
{
  "1":{
    "1":{
      "Input":"Text",
      "Output":"Text"}
    "2":{
      ...
      }
    ...
  }
} 
The json files will end up in the JSON folder (Keep the JSON folder with main.py)
